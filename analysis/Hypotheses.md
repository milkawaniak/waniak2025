H1 (Direct-access awareness):
If people directly notice when they are influenced, then only first-person awareness judgments should predict AMP performance. Third-person judgments should not show the same relationship.

H2 (Inferential awareness):
If awareness judgments are based on inference rather than direct access, then first-person and third-person awareness judgments should show similar patterns in how they relate to AMP performance.

We will use standard Pearson correlation (two-tailed) computed on within-subject data, specifically the correlation between first-person and third-person influence-awareness judgments
