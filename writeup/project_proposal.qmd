## Introduction

### Why did I choose this project?

The paper directly relates to my interests in emotional awareness and mental health. It explores the connection between alexithymia (difficulty identifying and describing emotions, as well as an externally oriented thinking style) and depression. It is important for me to understand the extent to which alexithymia correlates with mental health, and I am particularly curious about this connection in subclinical populations. Additionally, the project has interesting analysis, and I would like to learn how to do that. 

### A description of the stimuli and procedures that will be required to conduct this experiment, and what the challenges will be.

I will recruit participants through Prolific and ask them to complete the alexithymia (TAS-20), depression (BDI-I), and demographics questionnaires. I will conduct the same analyses as the original study: Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, the “Extended Bayesian Information Criterion” (EBIC), the “Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator” (LASSO) regularization method, and related network analyses. I will also calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient.

The original study recruited 839 participants who responded to the online questionnaire, of whom 319 reported a current depressive disorder. Later, the participants underwent therapeutic treatment, but only baseline data were included in the analyses. In my study, I aim to recruit 100 participants.

The biggest challenges may arise from the fact that the analyses conducted in the original paper likely required a larger sample size, and the population I recruit may end up being subclinical. The study should not take too long, but I am concerned that my sample size may be smaller due to the cost involved in participant recruitment.
